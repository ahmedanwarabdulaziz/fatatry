# Project Rules

1. **Refactoring**: When asked to refactor a function, output ONLY the updated code. No explanations.
2. **Changes**: When complying with change requests, give at most 3 short bullet points describing them. No extra commentary.
3. **Documentation**: Do not create or update README or documentation unless explicitly asked.
